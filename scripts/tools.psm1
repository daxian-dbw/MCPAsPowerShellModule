.SYNOPSIS

Retrieves merged pull requests from the PowerShell repository that are marked for backport consideration to a specific target release.

.DESCRIPTION

This script queries the PowerShell GitHub repository to find merged pull requests that have been labeled for backport consideration to a specified target release version. It uses the GitHub CLI to fetch PR information including number, title, URL, and merge date, then sorts the results from oldest to newest based on merge date.

The script targets PRs with labels in the format "Backport-{TargetRelease}.x-Consider" where TargetRelease is the specified version.

.PARAMETER TargetRelease
The target PowerShell release version to check for backport consideration. Must be one of: '7.4', '7.5', or '7.6'.
This parameter is mandatory and determines which backport label to search for.

.OUTPUTS

System.Object[]. Returns an array of PowerShell objects containing PR information with properties:
- number: The pull request number
- title: The pull request title
- url: The pull request URL
- mergedAt: The date and time when the PR was merged

.SYNOPSIS

Verifies if a specific pull request from the PowerShell repository is eligible for backport to a target release.

.DESCRIPTION

This script validates whether a specific pull request is ready for backporting to a specified target release version. It performs several validation checks:

1. Verifies the PR is in a merged state
2. Checks if the PR has already been backported (has "Backport-{TargetRelease}.x-Done" label)
3. Searches for existing backport PRs to prevent duplicates

The script uses the GitHub CLI to fetch PR information and returns a validation result object with detailed feedback about the backport eligibility.

.PARAMETER PRNumber
The pull request number to verify for backport eligibility. This parameter is mandatory.

.PARAMETER TargetRelease
The target PowerShell release version to check for backport eligibility. Must be one of: '7.4', '7.5', or '7.6'.
This parameter is mandatory and determines which backport version to validate against.

.OUTPUTS

System.Management.Automation.PSCustomObject. Returns a PowerShell object containing:
- pr_info: Original PR information (state, merge_commit, title, author, labels)
- validation_status: "success" if eligible for backport, "failed" if not
- validation_feedback: Detailed message explaining the validation result
- existing_backport_pr_info: Information about existing backport PR (if found)
- original_pr_Info: Original PR info when backport already exists
